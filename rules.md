#Rules
Version 0.0.3

##Setup

For each player in turn order: Place 4 troops in an empty territory.

##General Rules

###Movement

Each troop counter can only move a maximum of 1 territory in a turn.

##Turn

1. Place all incoming troops on territories you control.
2. Make as many attacks as you like.
3. Put aside an amount of incoming troops equal to a half of the territories you control, to a minimum of 2.

##Attacking

1. The attacker chooses how many troops from a territory are attacking the chosen adjacent territory.
2. The attacker creates a dice pool, with one dice for each attacking troop. The defender does the same with one defense die for each defending troop.
3. Both the attacker and defender roll their dice pools behind their screens, such that they can't see what the other has rolled.
4. Both the attacker and defender reveal a dice roll at the same time.
5. The lower dice is put aside in the dead pile, while the other goes to the surviving pile. In case of a tie, the defending die counts as being higher.
6. Repeat steps 4 - 5 until one player has no more die behind their screen.
7. Remove a defending troop or attacking troop for defending or attacking die in the dead pile respectively.
8. If there are no more troops left in the defending territory, move all remaining attacking troops into the now empty territory.

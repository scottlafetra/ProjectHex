Each troop counter can only move a maximum of 1 territory in a turn unless otherwise stated.

Assault has a +1 modifier when resolving against a mounted unit.

Mounted has a +1 modifier when resolving against a ranged unit.

Ranged has a +1 modifier when resolving against an assault unit.

##Troop Capacity

You may only have as much troops in incoming and on the board as there are physical game peices. (50 peices per player)

##Abandonment

Unless otherwise stated, no troop can abandon a territory, that is, leave a territory without at least one troop to gaurd it.

##Win Condition

If at any time a player has 3 or more prestige, they win the game.

##Turn

1. Place all incoming troops on territories you control.
2. Move as many troops as you like as long as they don't go farther than they can move, enter enemy territory, or break the abandonment rule.
2. Make as many attacks as you like.
3. If you meet the requirement listed any mission cards in your Dossier, you gain the indicated amount of prestige, discard the mission card and draw a new one and place it into your Dossier face up. If the mission deck is empty, shuffle the discard pile and place it face down as the mission deck, then draw.
4. Put aside an amount of incoming troops equal to a half of the territories you control, to a minimum of 2. These troops may be of any unit for which your faction has a unit card for.
5. If you wish, discard one of you mission cards from your dossier and draw a new one.


##Attacking

1. The attacker chooses how many troops from a territory are attacking the chosen adjacent territory.
2. The attacker creates a dice pool, with one dice for each attacking troop. The defender does the same with one defense die for each defending troop.
3. Both the attacker and defender roll their dice pools behind their screens, such that they can't see what the other has rolled.
4. Both the attacker and defender place one of their dice on the unit selection card on the spot coresponding to the unit they wish to enter combat with.
5. Both the attacker and defender reveal a dice roll at the same time.
6. The defeder's dice value is decreased by the modifier of the attacking unit and increased by the modifier of the defending unit. This value may never go below 0 or above 9.
7. The player with the lower number removes their unit from the board. In case of a tie, the defending die counts as being higher.
8. Repeat steps 4 - 5 until one player has no more die behind their screen.
9. If there are no more troops left in the defending territory, move all remaining attacking troops into the now empty territory.

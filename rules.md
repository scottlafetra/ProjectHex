# Rules
Version 0.3.0.draft

## Setup

1. Each player draws two card from the Mission Deck. *Players place their mission cards face up in front of them. This area is called the Dossier.*
2. Players chose one or both of their cards to mulligan and place the mulliganed cards face down in a discard pile.
3. The discard pile is then shuffled and put on the bottom of the Mission Deck.
4. Each player draws as many mission cards as they mulliganed.
5. For each player in turn order: Place one of their control markers in an teritorry that is at least two spaces away from any teritorry with units on it.

## General Rules

### Drawing Mission Cards

If you draw a card that you meet the requirement for, discard it and draw another. *The grass is always greener somewhere else.*

## Control Markers

You control a territory if you have a control marker in it. Only one control marker may ever be in a territory at one time.

## Resurgance

If a player ever has no controlled territory at the beginning of their turn, they may place one of their control markers on any uncontrolled teritorry. If there are uncontrolled territories on the map, the resurging player may pick any territory and exchange the control marker on it with one of their own. 

## Win Condition

If at any time a player has 3 or more prestige, they win the game.

## Turn

1. Remove all non-royal cards from your discard and put them in your hand.
2. Buy as many fortresses as you want and put each on a territory you control that does not have a capital on it. How much each fortress costs depends on how far you place it from your capital.
4. Make as many attacks as you like.
5. If you meet the requirement listed any mission cards in your Dossier, you gain the indicated amount of prestige, discard the mission card and draw a new one and place it into your Dossier face up. If the mission deck is empty, shuffle the discard pile and place it face down as the mission deck, then draw.
7. If you wish, discard one of you mission cards from your dossier and draw a new one.


## Attacking

1. The attacker chooses a territory next to one they control and declares that they are attacking it.
2. If the territory is uncontrolled, the attack ends the attacker places one of their control tokens on the territory, and discards one card of their choice.
3. Both the attacking player and the defending player play a card face down from their hand.
4. Both players turn over the cards they played.
5. The if the attacker's revealed card has a higher value, they successfully take the attacked territory and replace the defender's control token with one of their own.
6. Both players place their revealed cards in their respective discard piles.

# Card Values

## Basic Cards

Basic Cards (2-10) all have their value listed on their face.

## Royal Cards

Royal Cards (Ace, King, Queen, Jack) all have diffrent methods for determining their value, listed below. Royal cards can only be used once per game, and are not removed from a player's discard pile at the begining of their turn. 

**Ace:** Has a value of 3, and removes the card the other player revealed from the from the game.

**King:** 

**Queen:** When this card is revealed, the player that played it imediantly swaps it with one of the cards in their discard pile. Play continues as if the swapped card was just revealed. (This will activate any "when this card is revealed" effects on the swapped card.)

**Jack:** When this card is revealed, the player that plays it discards a number of cards. This card's value is the number of cards discarded that way. If both players played a jack, then starting with the attacker, both players take turns either discarding a card or passing. The first player to pass counts as having the lower value card, then play resumes as normal.

# Rules
Version 0.1.3

## Setup

1. Each player draws two card from the Mission Deck. *Players place their mission cards face up in front of them. This area is called the Dossier.*
2. Players chose one or both of their cards to mulligan and place the mulliganed cards face down in a discard pile.
3. The discard pile is then shuffled and put on the bottom of the Mission Deck.
4. Each player draws as many mission cards as they mulliganed.
5. For each player in turn order: Place 4 troops and your capital in an teritorry that is at least two spaces away from any teritorry with units on it.

## General Rules

### Drawing Mission Cards

If you draw a card that you meet the requirement for, discard it and draw another. *The grass is always greener somewhere else.*

### Movement

Each troop counter can only move a maximum of 1 territory in a turn unless otherwise stated.

## Type Modifiers

Assault has a +1 modifier when resolving against a mounted unit.

Mounted has a +1 modifier when resolving against a ranged unit.

Ranged has a +1 modifier when resolving against an assault unit.

## Troop Capacity

You may only have as much troops in incoming and on the board as there are physical game peices. (50 peices per player)

## Abandonment

Unless otherwise stated, no troop can abandon a territory, that is, leave a territory without at least one troop to gaurd it.

## Resurgance

If a player ever has no controlled territory at the beginning of their turn, they may place their incoming troops on any one empty teritorry.

## Win Condition

If at any time a player has 3 or more prestige, they win the game.

## Turn

1. Place all incoming troops on territories you control.
2. Move as many troops as you like as long as they don't go farther than they can move, enter enemy territory, or break the abandonment rule.
2. Make as many attacks as you like.
3. If you meet the requirement listed any mission cards in your Dossier, you gain the indicated amount of prestige, discard the mission card and draw a new one and place it into your Dossier face up. If the mission deck is empty, shuffle the discard pile and place it face down as the mission deck, then draw.
4. Put aside an amount of incoming troops equal to a half of the territories you control, to a minimum of 2. These troops may be of any unit for which your faction has a unit card for.
5. If you wish, discard one of you mission cards from your dossier and draw a new one.


## Attacking

1. The attacker chooses how many troops from a territory are attacking the chosen adjacent territory.
2. The attacker creates a dice pool, with one dice for each attacking troop. The defender does the same with one defense die for each defending troop.
3. Both the attacker and defender roll their dice pools behind their screens, such that they can't see what the other has rolled.
4. Both the attacker and defender place one of their dice on the unit selection card on the spot coresponding to the unit they wish to enter combat with.
5. Both the attacker and defender reveal a dice roll at the same time.
6. Each player's die roll gets a bonus equal to the modifier of their attacking troop plus any bonus they get from unit type advantage. A roll of a 9 always counts as being highest regardless of modifiers and a roll of 0 always counts as being lower regardless of modifiers. 
7. The player with the lower number removes their unit from the board. In case of a tie, the defending die counts as being higher.
8. Repeat steps 4 - 5 until one player has no more die behind their screen.
9. If there are no more troops left in the defending territory, move all remaining attacking troops into the now empty territory.

# Playtest rules

To simulate a game where each faction has advanced through their tech tree, after everyone chooses their factions, have everyone choose a total of two unit cards and upgrade cards for their faction to use. 

# Card Descriptions

## Faction Cards
